Version 1:
[ ] FATAL:     Battery Conn is NOT SYMMETRIC
[ ] IMPORTANT: Seeduino Pin 7 on Front layer unconnected
[ ] IMPORTANT: No on/off switch *facepalm
[ ] IMPORTANT: Mount Holes are 3.4mm diam, not 1.7! KiCad uses Radius not Diameter
[ ] UX:        Pinkie stagger too aggressive; 
                  bottom-key very uncomfortable
[ ] AESTHETIC: Battery +/- silk is wonky
[ ] AESTHETIC: Row/Col silk on Back layer is not aligned
