## FAQ

#### WOA That's so cool! You should sell these!
No. I made this keyboard to fill a very particular need.
This keyboard was highly customized for myself. There are plenty of other companies out there
with exceptional split wireless keyboards.

#### Doesn't the battery run out?
Many wireless keyboards I've seen use a dinky 250 mAh LiPo battery, because it's very small.
Luckily I was able to squeeze a 750 mAh battery into mine, and I can go up to a month without charging it.

#### It must have such high typing latency, it's Bluetooth!
Nope! The latency is so negligible that it may as well be wired. I can easily exceed 100WPM with no
discernible lag.

#### But you can't use it for gaming.
Wrong. I game with it all the time. I'm not a leet-pro-mlg gamer, I just game casually now and then.
Games like Team Fortress 2 and Portal, nothing crazy. Works perfectly fine.
